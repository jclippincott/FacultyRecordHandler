Faculty Record Handler
======================

This program manages a file that contains faculty publications for Lipscomb's College of Computing and Technology.

Users can manage faculty publications in an existing file or start a new file, and then input any new publications.

The file will then be sorted by faculty name and publication date inside each faculty member, and output with the correct formatting.
